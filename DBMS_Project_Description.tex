\textbf{\large Motivation}
\end{flushleft}
As We visited the hospital important records get recorded in the following manner:\\ Registration of patients is done by just writing the Patients name, age, and gender. Whenever the Patient comes up his information is stored freshly.  Bills are generated by recording price for each facility provided to Patient on a separate sheet and at last, they  all are summed up.  Diagnosis information to patients is generally recorded on the document, which contains patient information.  It is destroyed after some time period to decrease the paper load in the office. All this work is done manually by the receptionist and other operational staff and lot of papers are needed to be handled and taken care of on pen-paper.  Doctors have to remember various medicines available for diagnosis and sometimes miss better alternatives as they can't remember them at that time.  This will create many problems for the administration to handle the database like Lack  of immediate retrievals,  Lack  of immediate information storage, Lack of prompt updating, Error prone manual calculation.

\textbf{\large Description}
\end{flushleft}
The hospital management system will provide services to the hospital staff.  The database will store the data of the in and outpatients, patients’ medical history, special medication provided(if any) etc.  Personal details of in-patients like family, address, phone number and other contact details will be recorded.   It  will also provide data on hospital’s present infrastructure like available beds, wards, equipment etc.  Staff records like available doctors, nurses, ward-boys will also be maintained.  The doctors could be trainees, permanent, visiting or any kind of specialist.  Their personal records, professional experience will also be maintained.   List  of appointments for the outpatients will be recorded.   Finances of the hospitals like salaries of employees, cost of medicines, equipment, and other stuff will also be recorded.  This will help to generate a bill and keep a track of the revenue generated and other finances of the hospital.\\\\\\\
